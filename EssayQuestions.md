### Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?
---------------
I would like to make application that are useful to other people. I feel that if I can create software based on my idea, I will have the pleasure of making something new in the world from nothing. I always hope that I can ceate something that could help other people by making their tasks easier. I would like to see that I can make a positive impact to the world from my idea and product I am involved in.

From my limited experience learning programming, I found that there are many ways to solve a problem. There are different languages and even with the same language, there are more than one way to write program. Sometimes I found it could be confusing when I encounter a problem, but I continue to spend time on it. When I finally get something working, I feel very happy and proud that I have solved the problem and it is my own solution based on advise I get from others or something I learned from the internet.

I learned that even though I run into problems initially or make mistakes at first, I can continue to work on it. Even if my program already works, there are always something to improve and there could be better way to do it as I continuously learn to get better.

I tried to learn programming myself using Internet. I learned making web sites and I created a simple web site to handle my household accounting and keep track of money we spent. It was joyful to create such an application because I could see the application take shape little by little. When I changed the code and made an improvement, I can see how it affected the UI right away. Furthermore, I could know what I need to improve next after finishing each step.

In my current job, I have been involved in testing for software made by the company and I was coordinating the testing done by a vendor company hired by my company. So far I was only involved in manual testing, but since last month, I volunteered to start working on creating automation tests for the company's website. This is a side project that I am allowed to do so there is not much support for my automation project when I started, but I am glad I can spend some time and try to learn myself. I started with using UI based tools like selenium IDE and created test cases, and I am starting to export test cases in Java to make further improvements. It was good to find that I could do some programming in this job but there are no other tester for the company. On one hand it is good because I have to learn how to start by myself, but at the same time I wish I can learn from someone experienced on how to improve.

I am hoping that I could join the Ada program and continue to improve my development skill and work towards a full time job as a software developer.

### If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years? 
---
If I am able to join your program, I hope to start my new career as Software Developer in United States. After moving to United States, it was difficult for me to find new position in United States even though I have some engineer experience from my previous jobs as software tester in Japan. Many company requires proven coding skill and technical knowledge in previous experience.

With the coding skill and developent experience I gained from your program, I would be able to start as a software developer. I believe that once I can start my career as software developer, I will able to apply my skill from previous jobs as a software tester and project coordinator. I can see that in the next 5 years, I will be able combine all of my skill and experiences to provide a unique skill set that would be valuable to any development project.

In 5 years, I would like to become a senior developer in my work group and start being able to mentor other people. Nowadays I see a trend of companies requiring more and more developer with testing and project management skills, while less and less company would look for someone who can only do one task, whether it is coding, testing or project management. I hope that in the next few years, I will be able to mentor other peoples to broaden their skillset. I see that I can achieve my goal by joining your program and becoming a developer myself as a first step.

After working in United States in 5 years, I might consider moving back to Japan to continue my career there. It would be great if one day I can bring my ideas and what I learned from my career in the United States and help others who had similar struggle as mine, especially those who has similar background as me.

### After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?  http://adadevelopersacademy.org/program
----
I hope that I would be able to help others who went through similar difficulties in finding job as myself. I didn’t study computer science in college, but I was interested in computer and was able to join the IT industry and became a test engineer eventually. However, I was not able to progress beyond that because in Japan, it is almost impossible to change to another job even though I want to become a developer.

I heard changing career in the United States are more common in Japan, even though people already have long career in a different field. So I decided to move to United States when I had the chance. However, even with some background in the engineer field from Japan, I found it difficult to get attention from tech company here.

I want to be able to tell others in my situation that it’s ok. You will be able to get the career you want with some help from organizations such as Ada Developer Academy. And I would like to bring this kind of culture back to Japan too as I see the problem as even more serious in Japan.

I was impressed when I heard about Ada Developer Academy. I could not believe how people can get such great opportunity to learn coding in order to become a developer and build a new career as a woman who want to try break into the industry.

Not everybody can go to college to study computer science due to different reasons. And especially in Japan, the culture is that women become housewives after marriage, and companies don’t expect women to work anymore and don’t want to invest in developing a woman’s career. In the past, that is considered normal in Japan. Nowadays, I see that many women want to be involved and continue their career, but similar to me, don’t have the opportunity to gain the necessary skill to continue the career and eventually give up looking for jobs.
If I am able to tell other people about how I am successful in developing my career, I would like to convince others to keep trying hard as long as they are interested in technology.

It’s not just women, there are others who had different difficulties such as language barrier and physical disability who had problem with finding a job in the industry. If I am in a position to hire other people into my company, I would not hesitate to give someone from different background and experience a chance to join the industry and start learning.

Even though opportunities like Ada Developer Academy exists in the United States, I feel that not enough people can take the opportunity as only very few people are able to join your program each time. I feel there should be more opportunity provided to not just women, but different people from different background.

If it’s possible and I have the skill, I would like to contribute and become a volunteer so that there will be more and more similar programs, in the United States or even other countries. Perhaps one day I can bring this culture back to Japan and change people’s thinking there. If more women work in the tech industry, I believe it will be helpful to grow Japan economy itself even.

### Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently? 
----
I remember a mistake I made when I worked as a localized software test engineer in Japan.
In this case, I noticed an issue with the software early on, but I thought that the whole test team has not finished the test pass yet, so I would have more time before I have to file a bug. I thought the bug would not be difficult to fix and didn’t file the bug right away as I was busy with other test tasks.

However, when I finally filed the issue as a bug a few days later, my bug was rejected even though there was still time to fix the bug and the development team has not finished everything yet. I learned that the reason is my bug was considered a low priority bug compared to other more important issues. If I filed the bug earlier, it would be fixed but at the time I filed, there are too many other issues they need to take care of before shipping and consider my bug not important enough.
I really regretted leaving issue there when the product shipped. I knew I found the issue early but because of my mistake, the customers will get a product with lower quality.

I was relatively new to the job at that time. From this experience, I learned that it’s not enough to finish something before deadline. I should take care of issues right away without delay even though there is still time left according to the schedule.

Also, I learned about bug filing and fixing process by development team. I got a better understand about how development team has to fix many issues in a release and they might have different opinions about what bugs are higher priority.

Afterwards, I worked as pre-release Program Manager and coordinated bug filing by beta testers in the program. Based on my previous experience, I urged the testers to file any bug right away after they found the issue because developers will not have enough time to fix the issue they find if they file the bugs in the last minute. As it turns out, I improved bug fix rate for the products that I was in charge of.

When I look back to the time I made the mistake about filing the bug too late myself, I didn’t know about how developers can be busy fixing many issues trying to release the product on schedule, and I was too busy myself running test every day and could not see potential issues around me as well. But from mistakes, I learned about the importance of taking quick actions to the issues I found and whenever I can, I would tell my experience to others so they don’t make the same mistakes as I did.
